## Setup

Run the following command to pull all the submodules:
```bash 
    git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Now you can explore all the folders and see my attempts at using the model. The model I used for the app is the [XTSS 2](./coqui_xtss/README.md) model. I have created a README for it, which you can read if you want to use this model.
